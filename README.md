# WARNING!

This project has entered on looking for new owner stage.

Developing this tool has being great, but recently I ([@gilmarsquinelato](https://github.com/gilmarsquinelato)) am not contributing too much with it, and I don't think it's fair to the people that are 
using this tool, so I am stopping to contribute with this tool and happy to transfer the project to the people that really wants to keep maintaining it.

Thank you!
